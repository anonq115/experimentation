# experimentation
-----i have explored and experiment many ideas and they most often likely than not break everytime but i take the diamond pieces and refine it more and more and even use it on other projects
-----if an idea is not working refine it refine it refine it does not mean starting over although you will really know when to start over and try another approach/idea but more often than not you pick the right solution and it starts to look what others have
cocluded and put it in their end product. you might even find yours is alot better even though its similar.
----------just because the experiment end  is unworthy doesnt mean the underlying ideas cant work somewhere else
